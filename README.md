POM is a design pattern which is commonly used in Selenium for Automating the Test Cases. This design pattern can be used with any kind of framework like keyword-driven, Data-driven, hybrid framework, BDD etc.

Page class contains web elements and methods to interact with web elements. While Automating the test cases, we create the object of these Page Classes and interact with web elements by calling the methods of these classes.

Using Apache POI External library, get data from Excel file. Intialize Propery file to retrive property data( Static ).
